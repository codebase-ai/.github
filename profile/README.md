# Codebase AI
In a world full of possibilities, a software developer finds comfort in her home office, surrounded by her critters. Using AI that understands her entire codebase, she strives to boost her productivity, impress her boss, and safeguard her treasured work-from-home arrangement, avoiding the return to the office she dreads.

## Who
Codebase AI is being developed by [Brendan](https://github.com/brendanmd1), [Ethan](https://github.com/ethand12), [Duff](https://github.com/ggduff) and [Bill](https://github.com/william-kerr).

## What
It's a powerful tool that enhances your coding experience by providing intelligent code suggestions based on your entire codebase.

## Where
You can leverage Codebase AI in two ways:

- As a Visual Studio Code extension, it offers code suggestions from OpenAI GPT while you work.
- As a GitHub Action, it enables you to leverage the power of [OpenAI's Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings).

## When
[Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/codebase-ai/projects/1/views/3)

## Why
By generating embeddings from your entire codebase, it captures the semantic relationships and context of your code. This enables Codebase AI to provide intelligent and context-aware code suggestions.
